This plugin utilizes the shortcode [login_form] to present users with login form, lost password recovery and password reset fields on the front end of a WordPress site.

== Description ==

This plugin utilizes the shortcode [login_form] to present users with login form, lost password recovery and password reset fields on the front end of a WordPress site. The plugin heavily filters login and authentication urls to keep visitors from being sent to wp-login.php. It does not prevent a user from going directly to wp-login. The plugin blocks all non administrators from accessing the dashboard by doing a redirect to the homepage.

This plugin is designed for use with [Gravity Forms by Rocketgenius, Inc.](http://www.gravityforms.com/ "Gravity Forms"), presenting a visitor a standard login box in place of forms which are restricted to logged in users only. It can also be used with other plugins that show content for non-logged in users, such as [User Status Shortcode By Story Block Media](https://wordpress.org/plugins/user-status-shortcode/ "User Status Shortcode").

A few notes about this plugin:

*   Plugin not tested with WordPress Network
*   Password reset and password recovery are all done on the page with the shortcode

== Installation ==

Installation is very basic:

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/wp-front-end-login` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
1. Insert [login_form] shortcode on page or post.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this plugin secure? =

All login and authentication logic is indentical to functions used in wp-login, just adjusted to work in a shortcode.

= Is this plugin compatible with other login and security plugins? =

This plugin has not been tested with other login and security plugins, such as recaptcha or simple math. Feedback is welcome for any success or failures with other login plugins.

= Are all the login styles and scripts loaded? =

This plugin only loads the admin forms css, not the complete login css collection. This seems to work well with most themes during testing.
